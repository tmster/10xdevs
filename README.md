## Testing

The project uses a comprehensive testing approach:

### Unit and Integration Testing

Unit and integration tests are written using Vitest and React Testing Library. They focus on testing individual components, utilities, and services.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests use Playwright and follow the Page Object Model pattern for better maintainability:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run e2e

# Run e2e tests with UI mode (for debugging)
npm run e2e:ui

# Generate tests from browser interactions
npm run e2e:codegen

# View test reports
npm run e2e:report
```

#### Page Object Model

The e2e tests are organized using the Page Object pattern:

- `e2e/pages/` - Contains page objects that encapsulate page structure and actions
- `e2e/*.spec.ts` - Test specifications that use the page objects

This separation makes tests more maintainable and easier to update when the UI changes.

## Project Scope

The project aims to provide a modern, type-safe web application with:

- Fast page loads using Astro's partial hydration
- Interactive UI components built with React
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Robust type safety with TypeScript
- Comprehensive testing at all levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Modern development tooling and best practices
